# IMDb-Project-PostgreSQL
A project that showcases a few queries on IMDb's dataset using a local PostgreSQL server.

- Database schema setup and query questions are all included in "PostgreSQL Movie Queries for Analysis.pdf".
- Queries.sql can be run to automatically execute the queries.
- query-output.txt is the result of said queries.

Data for this project were assembled by Rounak Banik from The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org) and MovieLens (https://movielens.org). 
The data includes 32,207 distinct movies released between 1878 and 2020, their genres, and nearly 8.4 million movie ratings made by more than 250,000 users.
